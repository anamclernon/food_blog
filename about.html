        <h2>Why I Started Cooking</h2>
        <p>
            After spending long hours sitting at a desk on a laptop, I realized the importance of taking breaks and engaging in activities that not only relax the mind but also provide physical relief. Cooking became my go-to hobby as it allowed me to stand up, move around, and rest my forearms after a day of continuous typing.

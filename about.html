        <h2>Why I Started Cooking</h2>
        <p>
            After spending long hours sitting at a desk on a laptop, I want to take a breaks and do stuff that not only relax the mind but also where I am not doing repetitive motion on my phone or laptop. I hope cooking becomes my go-to hobby as it allowes me to stand up, move around, and rest my forearms after a day of continuous typing.

        <h2>About This Cooking Website</h2>
        <p>
            This cooking website was created with a simple philosophy: no unnecessary tracking cookies and no loooong boring life stories before the recipes. I believe that cooking should be enjoyable and accessible to everyone without having to sift through endless personal anecdotes. Here, you'll find a collection of delicious recipes without any distractions.
